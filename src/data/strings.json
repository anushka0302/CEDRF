    "type": "Two Pointers",
    "scenario": "Utilize two pointers when the problem involves searching for pairs or triplets of characters within a string that satisfy specific conditions, particularly in sorted strings or when the order matters.",
    "clue": "Look for problem descriptions mentioning the need to compare characters from both ends of the string or to traverse the string simultaneously with two pointers. Phrases like 'pair of characters', 'triplet of characters', or 'sorted string' indicate the potential application of two pointers.",
